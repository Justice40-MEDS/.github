## Hi there 👋


This GitHub organization hosts the code and documentation used in a Capstone Project submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Master of Environmental Data Science for the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara

## Summary: 
In January 2021, the federal government launched the Justice40 Initiative, which aims to direct 40% of overall benefits from investments in climate, clean energy, affordable housing, workforce development, remediation, pollution reduction and clean water infrastructure to disadvantaged communities (DACs). As part of this initiative, the federal government created the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) to identify which communities (census tracts) are considered disadvantaged and in need of federal funding based on the presence of low-income status and at least one of eight burden categories. While CEJST includes a wide range of useful indicators to evaluate burdens and designate DACs, it relies on a binary classification scheme that identifies U.S. census tracts as either DACs or non-DACs. Specifically, CEJST does not include any measure that represents cumulative burdens or overall harm to communities that occurs due to a combination of climate, environmental, socioeconomic, and health-related burdens (Shrestha 2023). A DAC meeting multiple criteria or indicator thresholds is assigned the same designation as a DAC meeting a single criterion and does not receive any special prioritization for Justice40 funding. This inability to distinguish between areas with severe, moderate, or lower burdens hinders the model's effectiveness, as identified in the recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus report (NASEM 2024). This project seeks to improve CEJST’s model by assessing the cumulative impact of climate and environmental burdens across communities in the U.S. The project team will utilize spatial analytic tools to highlight geographic clusters of communities that are overburdened using a cumulative assessment. They will implement techniques such as Local Indicators of Spatial Association that can be used to identify census tract clusters with significantly higher or lower levels of burden (Ansen 1995, Bivand & Wong 2018; Chakraborty 2024). By analyzing and incorporating cumulative burdens using cutting-edge geospatial techniques, the revised screening tool will promote more meaningful and equitable investment into disadvantaged communities facing the greatest risk from climate change.
